# RSI Speedrun

This is a game where you click your mouse as fast as you can for 10 seconds. 

I wrote the basic foundation for this game nearly 20 years ago when I was first learing javascript.

I've been learning Vue JS at my day job, and I decided a good way to start playing around with it was to port this simple game.

I also ended up adding some new features, such as:

- High Score Retention for the current session

- Large easy to read font ( JetBrains Mono )

- Full usage of available viewing area

- Restart functionality

If anyone plays around with this please know I am not liable for any damages you cause to yourself or to your mouse. The game can be really hard on both of those things.
